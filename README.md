# Tasbeeh — Dhikr & Du'a Tracker

A simple, lightweight dhikr and du'a tracker built with React, Vite and Tailwind.
Everything runs in the browser and all user data stays on the device.

## Features

- After-salah adhkar routine with per-item targets and one-tap counting
- 70+ categorised du'as with search across titles, meanings, transliteration and tags
- Focus mode for distraction-free recitation, with next/previous navigation
- Personal collections: favourites, custom du'as, and full surahs fetched from the Quran API
- Backup & restore to a JSON file
- Eight themes (including system-follow and light), Bangla/English UI, adjustable Arabic and Latin font sizes
- Installable PWA that works offline, fonts included

## Local development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- npm

### Run locally
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the local URL shown in the terminal.

### Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Dev server on port 3000, reachable from other devices on the network |
| `npm run build` | Production build into `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | Type-check the project (`tsc --noEmit`, strict mode) |
| `npm run i18n:report` | Translation coverage: missing UI keys and content fields |
| `npm run clean` | Remove `dist/` |

## Testing on a phone

### Option 1 — the deployed build (needed for install and offline)

Pushing to `main` (or running the workflow from the **Actions** tab) builds the
app via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and publishes it to GitHub Pages:

```
https://mokaramhossain.github.io/Tasbeeh---Dhikr-Dua-Tracker/
```

The workflow enables Pages itself on first run. This requires the repository to
be **public** — GitHub Pages cannot publish a private repository on the free
plan.

Because Pages serves from `/<repo-name>/` rather than the domain root, the
workflow builds with `VITE_BASE=/<repo-name>/` so asset URLs and the
service-worker scope carry that prefix.

Open the URL on the phone to test everything, including installing the app and
running it offline. To check offline mode:

1. Open the URL, then use *Add to Home Screen* (Share menu on iOS, ⋮ menu on Android).
2. Open the app once from the home screen so the service worker caches the assets.
3. Turn on airplane mode and reopen it — the app should load normally, with the
   Arabic typeface intact (Google Fonts are runtime-cached).

### Option 2 — the dev server over Wi-Fi (UI checks only)

`npm run dev` binds `0.0.0.0:3000`, so with the phone on the same network:

```bash
npm run dev
# find your computer's LAN IP:
#   macOS/Linux: ipconfig getifaddr en0   or   hostname -I
#   Windows:     ipconfig
# then open http://<that-ip>:3000 on the phone
```

Useful for checking layout, fonts and touch targets with live reload.

**This cannot test install or offline mode.** Service workers only run in a
secure context, and a plain `http://192.168.x.x` address is not one, so the
service worker never registers. That is browser policy, not a bug in the app —
use option 1 for anything PWA-related.

## Notes

- User data is stored locally in the browser/app storage under `dhikr-*` keys.
  `src/utils/backup.ts` lists every key that is included in an export.
- Reads of stored data are validated and fall back to defaults, so a corrupt
  entry cannot brick the app; an error boundary provides a recovery screen.
- Day counts are pruned to the most recent 400 days so storage cannot grow
  without bound.
- A new deploy does not silently swap itself in. The service worker is
  registered in `prompt` mode, so a newer build installs and waits, and
  `src/components/UpdatePrompt.tsx` offers a **Reload** bar — one tap, rather
  than the two page loads a self-updating worker needs before its changes are
  visible. An open app re-checks hourly. Reloading is never automatic: someone
  may be mid-recitation with a count on screen.

  The change to `prompt` mode takes one transition to land. Anyone who already
  has the old self-updating worker installed will need to open the app twice
  after this release; from then on they get the prompt.
- The base path is set from the `VITE_BASE` env var at build time, so the same
  source serves correctly from a domain root (local preview, or a host like
  Cloudflare Pages) and from a sub-path (GitHub Pages). It defaults to `/`.
- Languages are defined in `src/locales/index.ts`. Each entry carries the
  language tag, native label, text direction, numerals, font stack and script,
  and the UI strings live in `src/locales/<code>.ts` keyed by their English
  text — so a missing translation falls back to readable English. Item content
  (titles, meanings, benefits) stays beside each item in `src/data`. Adding a
  language means adding one file and one registry entry;
  `npm run i18n:report` shows what is still missing. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Transliteration is only shown when it is written in the reader's own script.
  71 of the 83 items store the Latin transliteration under both languages, which
  is unreadable for someone using the Bangla interface, so it is hidden there
  until Bengali-script versions exist.
- The app version shown in About comes from `package.json` at build time
  (`__APP_VERSION__`), so a release is a single edit.
- **Reminders are not built, and cannot be on the web.** The Notification
  Triggers API that would schedule a local notification was abandoned by
  Google; iOS has no equivalent and its web push needs a push server, which
  would contradict the app being offline-only with nothing leaving the device;
  and Periodic Background Sync is Chromium-only, install-only, and fires on
  ~12-hour heuristics rather than at a chosen time. A reminder built here would
  only fire while the app was already open, which is not a reminder. It belongs
  in the Android build, where local notifications schedule properly and offline.
- **Hijri dates are calculated, never asserted.** `Intl` with the
  `islamic-umalqura` calendar gives the date with no library and no location.
  But that calendar is calculated and local moon sighting commonly differs by a
  day, so the app names a period ("the last ten nights") rather than claiming a
  date, and Settings carries a ±1 day correction the reader sets themselves.
  Asking the device where it is would cost privacy and still be a guess.
- The visible brand is **Qubeq**, but the Android application id is
  `com.moizit.dhikrtracker`. This is deliberate: an application id can never be
  changed once an app is published on Google Play, so it is left as-is. Decide
  before the first submission whether to keep it or start fresh under a
  `com.qubeq.*` id — after publishing, that choice is permanent.
- For Android and iOS packaging, this web build can be wrapped later with Capacitor.
